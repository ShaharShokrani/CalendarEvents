# CalendarEvents

A social public calendar to collaborate events between people.

How does it works?

In order to view the available events, just choose a desired filter based on your preferences and then you will be able to see a page full of calendar based events.

See examples here: https://fullcalendar.io/.

The system will have a login/signup using OAuth.

Like the stackoverflow users, each user will have the ability to modify/create events by a privileged based table, so when event change occur, everyone can see it.

In order to make the events view more custom, each user will be able to save its own various filters.
Filter types:
    Target Audience.
    Duration.
    Time.
    Genre.
    SubGenre.
    Location.
    City.
    Address.
    Price.
